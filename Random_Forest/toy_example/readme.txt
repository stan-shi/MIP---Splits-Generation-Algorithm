The frequency of the features must be aligned with the output (% Silica Concentrate). There is no point about running the algorithm on each record because we know that none of them actually predicts the average % Silica Concentrate. It is only the combination of all parameters over a period of time which gives with the averaged % Silica Concentrate.

Therefore, I am grouping and averaging all records by % Silica Concentrate. 

Random forests are build upon 50000 observations
